## 3. End-to-End Testing Scenarios

### 3.1 Test Scenario 1: Complete Customer Booking Flow

**Objective**: Verify a customer can search for a hotel, book a room, and complete payment.

**Prerequisites**:
- Database seeded with test data
- Server running on localhost:3000
- Postman or API client ready

**Test Steps**:

#### Step 1: User Registration
```http
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "first_name": "Abebe",
  "last_name": "Kebede",
  "phone": "+251911234567",
  "password": "TestPass123!",
  "role": "hotel_owner"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Returns JWT token
- ✅ Returns user object with ID
- ✅ Password is not returned in response

**Validation**:
```javascript
// Store returned values
jwt_token = response.data.token
user_id = response.data.user.id

// Verify token format (JWT)
assert(jwt_token.split('.').length === 3)
```

#### Step 2: Search Hotels
```http
GET /api/hotels?city=Addis Ababa&limit=10&offset=0
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Returns array of hotels in Addis Ababa
- ✅ Hotels have id, name, address, rating, amenities
- ✅ At least 1 hotel returned

**Validation**:
```javascript
hotel_id = response.data.hotels[0].id

// Verify hotel has required fields
assert(hotel_id exists)
assert(hotel_name is string)
```

#### Step 3: Check Room Availability
```http
GET /api/hotels/{hotel_id}/rooms/available?checkin=2025-10-01&checkout=2025-10-03

```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Returns available rooms for dates
- ✅ Each room has id, type, price, capacity
- ✅ At least 1 available room

**Validation**:
```javascript
room_id = response.data.rooms[0].id
price_per_night = response.data.rooms[0].price_per_night
nights = 2

// Calculate expected total
expected_total = price_per_night * nights
```

#### Step 4: Create Booking
```http
POST /api/bookings
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "room_id": {room_id},
  "check_in_date": "2025-10-01",
  "check_out_date": "2025-10-03",
  "guest_count": 2,
  "guest_name": "Abebe Kebede",
  "guest_email": "abebe@example.com",
  "guest_phone": "+251911234567",
  "special_requests": "Late check-in please"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 201 Created
- ✅ Returns booking object with ID
- ✅ Total amount matches calculation
- ✅ Status is "pending"
- ✅ Room is marked as "booked"

**Validation**:
```javascript
booking_id = response.data.booking.id
total_amount = response.data.booking.total_amount

// Verify calculations
assert(total_amount === expected_total)
assert(response.data.booking.status === 'pending')
```

#### Step 5: Initiate Payment
```http
POST /api/payments/initiate
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "booking_id": {booking_id},
  "provider": "chapa"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Returns payment URL
- ✅ Returns provider reference
- ✅ Payment status is "pending"

**Validation**:
```javascript
payment_id = response.data.payment.id
payment_url = response.data.payment_url
provider_reference = response.data.provider_reference

// Store for callback
assert(payment_url contains 'chapa')
```

#### Step 6: Simulate Payment Callback
```http
POST /api/payments/callback
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "reference": "{provider_reference}",
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_id": "TXN123456789"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Payment status updated to "completed"
- ✅ Booking status updated to "confirmed"
- ✅ Payment log created

**Validation**:
```javascript
assert(response.data.payment.status === 'completed')
assert(response.data.booking.status === 'confirmed')
```

#### Step 7: Verify Booking Details
```http

  COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) as booking_count
FROM hotels h
LEFT JOIN rooms r ON h.id = r.hotel_id
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON h.id = b.hotel_id
GROUP BY h.id, h.name;

-- Check user roles
SELECT role, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY role;
```
