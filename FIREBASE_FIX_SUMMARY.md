# Firebase Service & Featured Hotels Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to address the Firebase service unavailability and missing featured hotels endpoint issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Firebase Service Unavailable (503 Error)

**Problem**: The `/api/auth/firebase` endpoint was returning a 503 error with the message "Firebase service is not available" after successful login.

**Root Cause**: The Firebase Admin SDK was not properly initialized due to missing environment variables, but the error messages were not descriptive enough to help developers diagnose the issue.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `FirebaseService` initialization with detailed logging and troubleshooting guidance.

#### Changes Made to `src/services/FirebaseService.ts`:

1. **Improved Warning Messages**: When Firebase credentials are missing, the service now displays:
   - A clear warning emoji (⚠️) indicating the issue
   - Specific list of which environment variables are missing:
     - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
     - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Step-by-step instructions to configure Firebase

2. **Enhanced Success Messages**: When Firebase initializes successfully:
   - Shows a success emoji (✅)
   - Displays the project ID being used
   - Shows a truncated version of the client email for verification

3. **Better Error Handling**: When initialization fails:
   - Shows an error emoji (❌)
   - Displays the actual error message and stack trace
   - Provides a checklist of things to verify:
     - Service account credentials correctness
     - Private key format (must include `\n` for line breaks)
     - Firebase project existence and active status
     - Network connectivity to https://firebase.googleapis.com

#### Example Console Output:

**When Firebase credentials are missing:**
```
⚠️  Firebase credentials not configured. Firebase features will be disabled.
Missing Firebase environment variables:
  - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
  - FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
  - FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
To enable Firebase features:
  1. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
  2. Generate a new private key
  3. Set the environment variables in your .env file
  4. Restart the server
```

**When Firebase initializes successfully:**
```
✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
   Project ID: your-firebase-project-id
   Client Email: firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your...
```

### 2. Missing `/api/hotels/featured` Endpoint (404 Error)

**Problem**: The mobile app was calling `GET /api/hotels/featured` to load featured hotels on the home screen, but this endpoint didn't exist, resulting in a 404 error.

**Solution**: Implemented a new endpoint that returns a list of featured hotels.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added `getFeaturedHotels` method to `src/controllers/HotelController.ts`**:
   - Returns up to 10 featured hotels by default (configurable via `limit` query parameter)
   - Filters for active hotels only
   - Orders by creation date (most recent first)
   - Includes room count and price range for each hotel
   - Returns structured JSON response with success status

2. **Added route in `src/routes/hotelRoutes.ts`**:
   - Registered `GET /featured` route (placed before the generic search route to prevent path conflicts)
   - Added comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Documented query parameters, response schema, and error cases

3. **Updated API documentation in `src/routes/index.ts`**:
   - Added the new endpoint to the `/api/docs` response
   - Added to the 404 handler's list of available routes

#### API Endpoint Details:

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/hotels/featured`

**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of hotels to return (default: 10, max: 100)

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "hotels": [
      {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "name": "Skylight Hotel",
        "location": "Addis Ababa",
        "description": "Luxury hotel in the heart of the city",
        "status": "active",
        "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
        "room_count": 15,
        "price_range": {
          "min": 1500,
          "max": 5000
        }
      }
    ],
    "total": 10
  }
}
```

**Error Response** (500):
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to fetch featured hotels",
  "error": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"
}
```

## How to Configure Firebase (If Not Already Done)

If you're seeing the Firebase warnings and want to enable Firebase features:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project** (or create a new one)
3. **Navigate to Project Settings** > **Service Accounts**
4. **Click "Generate New Private Key"**
5. **Download the JSON file**
6. **Add these to your `.env` file**:

```bash
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

**Important Notes**:
- The private key must be in quotes
- Line breaks must be represented as `\n` (not actual line breaks)
- After setting the environment variables, restart the server

7. **Restart the server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
```

## Testing the Changes

### Test Firebase Error Messages

1. Start the server without Firebase credentials:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. You should see the improved warning messages in the console

3. Try calling the Firebase endpoint (with a valid JWT):
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/auth/firebase
   ```

4. You should get a 503 response with the message "Firebase service is not available"

### Test Featured Hotels Endpoint

1. Ensure the database is seeded with hotel data:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:all
   ```

2. Call the featured hotels endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/featured
   ```

3. You should get a JSON response with featured hotels

4. Test with a custom limit:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/featured?limit=5
   ```

## Build Verification

All changes have been tested:

```bash
npm run build  # ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
npm test       # ✅ All tests passing (6/6)
```

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- ✅ Firebase gracefully degrades when not configured
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New endpoint follows existing API patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Featured Hotels**: Consider adding an `is_featured` column to the hotels table for more explicit control over which hotels appear as featured, rather than just showing the most recent ones.

2. **Firebase Analytics**: To address the Firebase Analytics warning mentioned in the issue, the mobile app needs to configure `google_app_id` in its Firebase config.

## Files Changed

- `src/services/FirebaseService.ts` - Enhanced initialization logging
- `src/controllers/HotelController.ts` - Added getFeaturedHotels method
- `src/routes/hotelRoutes.ts` - Added /featured route with Swagger docs
- `src/routes/index.ts` - Updated API documentation
